🌐 Adverse Media Review SOP (LLM-Driven)

Step	What the LLM must think through	Evidence it reads	Decision rule to apply	What the rationale must say (concise, specific)
1) Case intake	Restate who the subject is (anchors for later reasoning)	Subject profile (name, DOB, location, employer, ID data) + vendor hits metadata	None	“Subject: <full name>, DOB <dob>, city <city>, employer <employer>. Vendor hits: N articles.”
2) Read article	Understand the full claim (not just headline)	Article headline, snippet/full text, date, publisher	None	1-line neutral paraphrase of what the article alleges/reports
3) Collect anchors	Pull all identity anchors from text	Mentions of names, employer, city, dob/age, titles, ids	None	List anchors found: e.g. “[employer: ABC Ltd, city: London, age: 38]”
4) Name match sanity	Decide if the name form is strong or weak	Name forms vs subject aliases	If common name → require ≥2 anchors; if rare name → 1 anchor may suffice	“common name, needs ≥2 anchors” OR “rare name, 1 anchor can suffice”
5) Anchor test	Check each anchor against subject profile	Anchors vs subject data	Record pass/fail per anchor	“employer: matches; city: matches; dob: not stated; age: conflict (1985 vs 1992)”
6) Contradiction scan	Look for hard conflicts	DOB, age, geography, employer timeline, gender	If conflict, default to “no” unless multiple stronger anchors overrule	“dob conflict, subject 1992-06-14 vs article 1984-07-03”
7) Linkage decision	Decide if article is about the subject	Results from 4–6	Yes if name + ≥2 anchors w/out hard conflict. Maybe if weak. No if conflict or name-only.	Start with “Linkage: yes/maybe/no” and cite anchors (or conflicts).
8) Outcome classification	Classify the legal posture	Verbs & context in article	Map phrases → Allegation / Investigation / Charged / Convicted / Acquitted / Settled / Regulator order	“Outcome: charged (prosecutor filed charges on 2023-04-15)” and quote the trigger clause.
9) Category classification	Classify risk type	Article content, entities	Map → corruption, fraud, ML, TF, trafficking, sanctions evasion, violence, regulatory, civil, none	“Category: fraud, based on ‘charged with securities fraud’ in paragraph 3.”
10) Credibility note	Assess source quality	Publisher type	Gov/court > tier-1 > national > local > blog	“Credibility: tier-1 outlet (Financial Times, 2023-04-15)”
11) Recency note	Assess time relevance	Article date	Policy lookback (e.g. 7 yrs) → bucket: <12m / 12–36m / >36m	“Recency: within 12 months (2024-11-02).”
13) Per-article rationale (always 3 lines)	Produce concise, auditable record	All above steps for this article	Always 3 lines, even if “no”	Line 1: outcome + category + 1-line summary. Line 2: linkage call + anchors/contradictions. Line 3: credibility + recency + link.
14) Cluster duplicates	Merge repeated stories	Article titles, urls, key quotes	Keep most credible or detailed	“Clustered 4 duplicates → canonical BBC article.”
15) Case roll-up	Combine accepted stories	All per-article calls	Keep only yes/maybe stories for scoring	List accepted stories, sorted by strength.
16) Overall decision logic	Translate story set into recommendation	Outcomes + linkage + credibility + recency	Decline if convicted/regulator order within lookback + linkage yes. Escalate if charged/investigated. Clear if all no or only weak allegations.	Start with “Decision: clear/escalate/decline (score X/100) because…” and cite decisive stories.
17) Targeted ask (if escalate)	Help human reviewer resolve ambiguity	Contradictions + missing anchors	One precise doc/request	“Request: gov ID to confirm DOB, since article reports 1979 DOB.”
18) Final memo	Create regulator-auditable artifact	Top stories, decision, asks	8–10 lines, bullets, links inline	Bullets for each decisive story, list contradictions, next step, tags.
